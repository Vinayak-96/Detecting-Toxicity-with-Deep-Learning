# Detecting-Toxicity-with-Deep-Learning
As part of my final year capstone project, I used deep RNNs to detect the level of toxicity in the 2018 Jigsaw Toxic Dataset and compared it with traditional machine learning models. The main focus was on Gated Recurrent Units(GRUs) and Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) Networks.
